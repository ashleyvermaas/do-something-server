### What is doSomething?
It is a full-stack web application that allows users to find inspiration for fun activities to do. It provides a way to find positive activities to relieve boredom, be inspired and have tons of fun. Users can get random activities as well as create, update and delete their own activities (CRUD operations). After completing an activity, users can log an experience and rate it. doSomething creates a place of inspiration and fun, a place where boredom doesn't exist. 

### Ironhack Project #3
doSomething is the third and final project created by [Ashley Vermaas](https://github.com/ashleyvermaas) during the last module of the [Ironhack](https://ironhack.com/en) Web Development Bootcamp. The project consists of a full-stack web application using the MERN-stack and is deployed via Heroku and Netlify.
